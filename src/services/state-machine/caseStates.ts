// LEGACY FILE — DO NOT USE
// This file is intentionally left as a placeholder.
// Case states will be redefined in Layer-7+
// when the new lifecycle engine is introduced.

// (kept to avoid breaking legacy imports)


/*
✅ What this file does

Acts as a placeholder

Keeps legacy imports satisfied

Documents future intent

🧠 Why this file exists

It communicates:

“Case states will be redesigned later.”

Without this file:

someone might reintroduce old enums

or invent ad-hoc states elsewhere

This is architectural signalling.
