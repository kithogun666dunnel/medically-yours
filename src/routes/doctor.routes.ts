/*
✅ What this file is doing

This file exposes doctor-facing APIs.

Endpoints:

GET /dashboard

PATCH /cases/:id/close

GET /cases/closed

These are:

legacy / transitional endpoints

built on top of PatientCase model

used by older dashboard UI

🧠 Why this file still exists (important context)

Tumhare system me do parallel worlds hain:

1️⃣ Canonical world (new)

Case

CaseEvent

WhatsApp-first

Clean lifecycle

New case.routes.ts

2️⃣ Doctor dashboard world (legacy)

PatientCase

severity-based sorting

traditional CRUD APIs

doctor.routes.ts

👉 Is file ko delete nahi kiya gaya because:

dashboard abhi dependent hai

migration incremental hai

production break nahi karna

🔒 Boundary rule

Is file:

❌ new features add nahi honge

❌ new logic design nahi hoga

✅ sirf existing dashboard ko support karega

Agar koi engineer yahan naya logic add kare:
👉 architecture smell
